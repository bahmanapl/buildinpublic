I learned to be extrovert so I am an ambivert for a decade and half at least. I love learning new stuff.It would be cherry on the top if I could find few people to do it together. I am mostly questions statue que and like to look at a problem with different angles. (love finding a different point of view) . What matter the most to me : Modern Stoic principles ,Authenticity , Brutal honesty , learner and teacher mentality. My motivation are intrinsic as long as my basic human needs are covered.
